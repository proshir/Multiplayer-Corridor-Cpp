## Overview
Welcome to the Multiplayer Corridor Game repository! This project is the result of my advanced programming course at Tehran University, where I developed a multiplayer game in C++. The game offers real-time multiplayer action, allowing up to four players to join a room and navigate through a corridor together.

## Key Features
1. Real-Time Multiplayer Gameplay
Experience thrilling multiplayer action as you and your friends explore the game's corridor in real-time. The game's server-client architecture ensures seamless synchronization among players, enabling collaborative or competitive gameplay.

2. Room Creation and Management
Create game rooms and invite friends to join. The project provides easy-to-use room creation and management features, allowing players to host private games or join existing ones.

3. Smooth Graphics and Interactivity
The game leverages C++ to deliver smooth graphics and interactive gameplay. Navigate through the corridor, interact with objects, and compete or cooperate with other players in a visually engaging environment.

4. Cross-Platform Compatibility
The project is designed to work on various platforms, making it accessible to a wide audience of gamers. Compile the game for your preferred platform, whether it's Windows, macOS, or Linux.

5. Learning Resource
This project serves as an educational resource for C++ enthusiasts and aspiring game developers. It includes well-documented code, comments, and explanations of key game development concepts, making it a valuable learning tool.

## Getting Started
